# 🧪 Safe Testing Guide for Real-time Protection

## ⚠️ **IMPORTANT: These tests are SAFE and will NOT harm your system**

## 🎯 **How to Test Real-time Protection**

### **Step 1: Start the Antivirus**
```bash
python shieldsecure.py
```

### **Step 2: Enable Real-time Protection**
1. Click "🛡️ Enable Real-time Protection" button
2. Status should change to "🛡️ Real-time Protection: Active" (green)
3. Button should change to "🛑 Disable Real-time Protection"

### **Step 3: Run the Test**
```bash
python test_malware_detection.py
```

## 🔍 **What You Should See**

### **In the Test Console:**
```
🧪 Creating test file with known malware hash...
✅ Created test file: test_malware.exe
📊 File hash: d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e
🎯 Target hash: d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e
🔍 Hash match: True
⏳ Keeping file for 10 seconds to test real-time protection...
```

### **In the Antivirus UI:**
```
[2024-01-XX XX:XX:XX] 🚨 Real-time threat detected, processes terminated, and file quarantined: test_malware.exe (Terminated 0 processes)
```

### **In the Console (if running antivirus from terminal):**
```
⚠️ Suspicious file created: C:\Users\SHREYASH\Desktop\AntiVirusSoft\test_malware.exe
🚨 MALWARE DETECTED: C:\Users\SHREYASH\Desktop\AntiVirusSoft\test_malware.exe
✅ File quarantined: C:\Users\SHREYASH\Desktop\AntiVirusSoft\test_malware.exe
```

## ✅ **Success Indicators**

1. **File Detection**: Test file is detected as suspicious
2. **Malware Detection**: File hash matches known malware
3. **Process Handling**: No processes to terminate (safe test)
4. **Quarantine**: File is moved to quarantine folder
5. **UI Updates**: Real-time status updates in antivirus interface

## 🧹 **Cleanup**

The test automatically cleans up after itself, but if needed:
- Check quarantine folder: `C:\Users\SHREYASH\ShieldGuardData\quarantine\`
- Check threat logs: `C:\Users\SHREYASH\ShieldGuardData\threatlog.json`

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### **If no detection occurs:**
1. Ensure real-time protection is enabled
2. Check if monitoring the correct directories
3. Verify file extension is in suspicious list (.exe, .bat, etc.)

### **If file isn't quarantined:**
1. Check quarantine folder permissions
2. Verify antivirus has write access to ShieldGuardData folder

## 🎉 **What This Proves**

✅ Real-time file monitoring works  
✅ Suspicious extension detection works  
✅ Malware hash detection works  
✅ Process termination logic works  
✅ Auto-quarantine works
